To reproduce the experiments, follow these steps:

    1. Launch the script that runs the experiments with:

        $ python run_experiment.py
    
    This will generate some data in the data/ directory

    2. Visualize the results and plot figures. For this, first launch the jupyter notebook:

        $ jupyter notebook
    
    and run the notebook CMPT_plot_experiment.ipynb . This will generate the figures that were reproduced in the paper.
